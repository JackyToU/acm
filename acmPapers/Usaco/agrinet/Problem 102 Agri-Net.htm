<P>Farmer John has been elected mayor of his town! One of his campaign promises 
was to bring internet connectivity to all farms in the area. He needs your help, 
of course. 
<P>Farmer John ordered a high speed connection for his farm and is going to 
share his connectivity with the other farmers. To minimize cost, he wants to lay 
the minimum amount of optical fiber to connect his farm to all the other farms. 
<P>Given a list of how much fiber it takes to connect each pair of farms, you 
must find the minimum amount of fiber needed to connect them all together. Each 
farm must connect to some other farm such that a packet can flow from any one 
farm to any other farm. 
<P>The distance between any two farms will not exceed 100,000.

<H3>INPUT FORMAT</H3>
<TABLE border=1>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>Line 1: </TD>
    <TD>The number of farms, N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 100). </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Line 2..end: </TD>
    <TD>The subsequent lines contain the N x N conectivity matrix, where each 
      element shows the distance from on farm to another. Logically, they are N 
      lines of N space-separated integers. Physically, they are limited in 
      length to 80 characters, so some lines continue onto others. Of course, 
      the diagonal will be 0, since the distance from farm i to itself is not 
      interesting for this problem. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

<H3>OUTPUT FORMAT</H3>
<P>The single output contains the integer length that is the sum of the minimum 
length of fiber required to connect the entire set of farms.
