<A name="rules"></A>
<H3>Rules</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Every student must write at least one set of lecture notes, worth
	15% of your grade.  Depending on enrollment, some students might be 
	asked to write a second set of lecture notes worth another 15% of
	the grade; for these students the weight of the oral exam will
	decrase by 15%.  (Please let me know if you would like to be
	one of these students.)
	<p>
<LI> Lecture notes must be written in LaTeX. 
	No other forms are accepted.  
	If you are not familiar with
	LaTeX, get familiar quickly (it is an undispensable tool for
	anyone who ever wants to write an article/thesis in Computer
	Science or Mathematics).  Various decent LaTeX guides can be
	found on the Web, for example 
	<A href="http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/guides/latex/guide.html">here</A>.
	LaTeX should be installed on all UW-UNIX computers; you can also
	get a <A href="http://www.miktex.org">Windows version</A>.
	<p>
<LI> Please use the given template for the lecture notes.  (This should
	also help to get you started on LaTeX if it is new to you.)
	It contains suggestions for some basic LaTeX, as well as a few
	comments to keep the appearance of the lecture notes uniform.
	<p>
<LI> 10% of your grade are determined by the quality of the first version
	of the lecture notes that you give me.
	<p>
<LI><b>Material to be covered</b>:
	To get a passing grade, your lecture notes must reflect all material
	that was written on the board during the lecture.  To
	get a grade better than that, you should convert what
	was presented into a class into a miniature article.  In
	particular:
	<UL>
	<LI> Convert the content into complete sentences.
	<LI> Add lots of pictures to illustrate concepts.
	<LI> Complete those proofs for which I've given the proof in
		words (but not in written).  Try to fill in as much
		of the proofs that I've given in sketch as you can.
	<LI> Provide "warm-up" to every major result.  Explain what
		you're about to do, and why this is worth doing.
		For example, rather than just giving a definition,
		explain why we need this concept, and then give the
		definition.
	<LI> Do a web-search for some of the keywords that were used
		in class.  Read the background material (if I provided
		some).  If you see related results and references, 
		give them in your lecture notes.
	</UL>
As far as what all should be covered:
<UL>
<LI> You should cover all that I have covered in class and not much more.
	Recall definitions/results from earlier lectures if you need
	them, and provide an outlook to where this is going if appropriate,
	but do not cover material that was or will be fully covered in
	earlier/later lectures.
<LI> Keep the order of presentation more or less in the order it was
	done in class.
<LI> You do not need to mention administrative details 
	in your lecture notes.
	Incorporating the homework is optional; do it if it fits
	the flow nicely.  Do not include a proof of a homework.
</UL>
You are welcome to borrow my (hand-written) notes that I used
	to prepare the class from.  Recall that you are expected to
	do more than just transcribe those to LaTeX!
	<p>
<LI> Lecture notes are due two weeks after the class that you
	are covering by 6pm.
	<P>
<LI> Every day that you hand in the first version
	your lecture notes beyond the due 
	date will decrease your grade (1 percentage-point per day,
	so with more than 10 days late you won't get any credit).
	<p>
<LI> Hand in lecture notes by giving me a printout, or emailing
	me PostScript, or emailing me all the LaTeX sources.
	<p>
<LI> I will return a printout to you with some suggestions for
	improvement, normally within a few days of having received
	the notes.  Please incorporate those suggestions.
	<p>
<LI> 5% of your grade will be determined by the quality of the revised
	version of the lecture notes.  If I had
	no comments (rare!), then these 5% are automatically yours.  
	<p>
<LI> The revised version is due within a week from when you received
	my comments.  Every day beyond that will deduct 1 percentage-point.
	<p>
<LI> Please send me the revised version with 
	the complete sources (including LaTeX source files and source and
	PostScript files of any figures you
	may have drawn).  PostScript
	will be made available on the web; I may want to rewrite a few
	things as well, and therefore need the LaTeX sources, too.  Please
	send your files in a tar-file or a zip-file.
