On this page is a list of open problems.  Some may truly be open,
for some I may simply not have found the right reference. 
New open problems
will appear irregularly (whenever I stumble over one).
<p>

Any open problem that you solve will earn you some extra credit
(how much depends on the problem).  
It als may be a good foundation for future research projects.
<p>

If you think you have a solution to something, contact me.    If
you think you have a solution to a closely related problem, let me
know that, too.

<!--
<LI> <b>Hamiltonian cycle in interval graphs</b><br>
What is the status of the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle
in an interval graph?  
SOLVABLE: Alan Hill (found reference)
-->
<LI> <b>Maximum cut in interval graphs</b><br>
What is the status of the problem of finding a Maximum Cut
in an interval graph?
Is this NP-hard?  Is this poly-time solvable?
(It is known to be NP-hard in chordal graphs.)
<p>

<LI> <b>Interval graphs and Matroids</b><br>
Various greedy-algorithms work on interval graphs (e.g. for
coloring, independent set.)  Is there any connection between
interval graphs and matroids that would explain why this is so?
<p>

<LI> <b>Hamiltonian cycle in chordal graphs</b><br>
What is the status of the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle
in a chordal graph?
Is this NP-hard?  Is this poly-time solvable?
How about perfect graphs?
<p>

<LI> <b>Intersection graphs with few elements</b><br>
We know that every graph is an intersection graph if we represent
each vertex by S<sub>v</sub>={all edges incident to v}.  With
this formulation, we need m different elements (one for each edge)
to create the sets for the vertices.  <br>
Can we do this with n elements?   Or maybe even less?  Or can we
show that m elements are needed for some graphs?
<p>

<LI> <b>t-interval graphs</b> <br>
Every graph is a Delta-interval graph.  Is this the best possible,
i.e., is there a graph that isn't a (Delta-1)-interval graph, for
arbitrary Delta?  (Note that for Delta=2, the 4-cycle is a 2-interval
graph but not a 1-interval graph.)
<p>

<LI> <b>SP-graphs as boxicity-2 graphs</b> <br>
Is it true that every (simple) SP-graph is a boxicity-2 graph?
(We know this for triangle-free 2-terminal SP-graphs.  Dealing
with cutvertices is easy, but how to add the triangles?)
<p>
<LI> <b>Recognizing 2-outer-planar graphs</b><br>
We can recognize a 2-outer-planar graph in O(n<sup>2</sup>).  Can
we do better?  In particular, can we do O(n)?
